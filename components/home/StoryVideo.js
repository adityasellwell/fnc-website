/**
 * Featured Brand / Freshness Story Video.
 *
 * Full width always — matches the same Container the category circles
 * and product grid sit in, no max-width cap. The uploaded file is
 * exactly 2:1 (1600x800 — re-exported specifically for this section),
 * so aspect-2/1 here is an exact match: height scales naturally with
 * width (no fixed/capped height), object-cover crops nothing because
 * the box and the file are the same shape, and there are no black
 * bars because nothing needs letterboxing. This only stays correct as
 * long as the uploaded video stays 2:1 — if it's ever re-exported at a
 * different ratio, update aspect-2/1 to match exactly.
 *
 * Autoplays muted + looped with a corner mute/unmute toggle button.
